# challenge-4-

In this assignment i wrote a HTML, CSS, and Java-script file to create a webpage thats acts as a quiz over various topics that we have covered in class. The quiz cycles between showing questions and answers based off if the answer to the question has been selected. The quiz also has a displayed timer that counts down throughout the quiz and as incorrect answers are selected the user takes a time penalty of ten seconds. The local storage also saves the scores of user and displays them.
